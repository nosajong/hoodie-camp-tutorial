## Offline First

This tutorial implments ServiceWorker and can be run offline using a Chrome or Firefox browser. To run offline, turn off the server (Ctrl + C) and refresh [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) using Chrome or Firefox. The tutorial page will still load.

To remove the offline tutorial from [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) visit chrome://serviceworker-internals/ if using Chrome or visit about:serviceworkers if using Firefox and unregister the ServiceWorker. 

Don’t worry if your browser doesn't support ServiceWorker yet, it only means that you can’t reload the page without the server running.
